# thesis-code

Pointer repo for my PhD thesis "Parsimony and Performance in Rule-Based Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning".

Each of the three contrib. chapters in the thesis relies on the following repos:

- Chapter 3: Compaction of Michigan Populations in Discrete Environments, incorporating the publication "Optimality-Based Analysis of XCSF
Compaction in Discrete Reinforcement Learning" (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58115-2_33)
